# The Full Stack Sensei

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/headshot.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>

Hi! My name is Jochen Lillich. I'm a black belt in Geek Do, the not-quite ancient art of achieving one's goals by combining technology and passion. :D

I wrote my first line of code in 1984, launched my first Linux shell in 1992 and started my first IT business in 1994. Since then, I've been working as an IT manager at companies of all kinds of sizes.

I've been a geek since primary school, dabbling with chemistry, electronics and other things that peaked my interest. Then I got a computer and for the last few decades, the steady innovation in IT easily kept my mind occupied. I'm also a fan of Japanese martial arts, hence the name of this website.

Since 2010, I'm busy as the founder and CTO of [freistil IT](https://www.freistil.it), a small managed web hosting company based in Ireland and operated by an internationally distributed web operations team.

My favourite tools and topics are:

* IT automation (e.g. Chef, Kubernetes, CI/CD)
* Software engineering (I love coding in Ruby but I've learned more programming languages than I can count with my fingers)
* Distributed company culture

I live with my family at the Irish east coast near Dublin.
